### Hi there 👋

<!--
**third-stone/third-stone** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm an applied physics PhD student currently working nanophotonics design/fabrication for quantum information experiment. 

I'm always looking for new coding projects, some past side-projects include using streamlit + asyncio to create a labrad monitoring system as well as openCV to analyze SEM images.
