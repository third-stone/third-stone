### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an applied physics PhD student currently working nanophotonics design/fabrication for quantum information experiment. 

I'm always looking for new coding projects, some past side-projects include using streamlit + asyncio to create a labrad monitoring system as well as openCV to analyze SEM images.
